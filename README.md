How To Contribute To This Project

The default repo branch is `develop`

Clone the repo to your local machine

After working on something, before you push, always pull from branch "develop" first by running `git pull origin develop`

Then depending on what you work on `feat` or `chore` or `bug` checkout to a new branch e.g `git checkout -b feat/login-page`. N.B: Where `feat/login-page` will be the branch name you create.

Add your codes by running `git add .`

Commit and add your commit message e.g `git commit -m "feat: user login page"`

Push to remote repo on your new branch with `git push origin branch-name`

Then go to github and create a PULL REQUEST from your newly created branch to the `develop` branch.

All design implementation must be pixel perfect, no frameworks to be used and must be 100% responsive.
